# Checklist Workflow Rule

When working on project checklists such as [packages/shared/docs/checklists/phase3.5.1-indicator-testing-reporting.md](mdc:packages/shared/docs/checklists/phase3.5.1-indicator-testing-reporting.md), follow these guidelines:

1. **Focus on one checkbox at a time** - Complete a single task completely before moving to the next one
2. **Update the checklist** - Mark the checkbox as completed with `[x]` when finished
3. **Commit your changes** - After completing a task, commit both the implementation and the updated checklist
4. **Start fresh** - Begin a new chat session for each checklist item to maintain focus and context

## Example workflow:

1. Identify the next unchecked box in the checklist
2. Work on implementing just that one item
3. Test the implementation thoroughly
4. Update the checklist to mark the item as completed
5. Commit all changes with a descriptive message
6. End the current session and start a new one for the next item

This approach helps maintain clear progress tracking and creates logical, focused commits in the version history.
