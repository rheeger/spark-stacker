## Critical MVP MACD Strategy Implementation

A critical milestone in our development roadmap is the implementation of a MACD-based trading
strategy as a proof-of-concept for the entire system. This will serve as a practical validation of
all system components before full-scale deployment.

### MVP Strategy Details

- **Indicator:** MACD with parameters Fast=8, Slow=21, Signal=5
- **Market:** ETH-USD perpetual futures on Hyperliquid
- **Timeframe:** 1-minute candles
- **Position Size:** $1.00 maximum per position
- **Risk Parameters:**
  - Leverage: 10Ã—
  - Stop-loss: 5%
  - Take-profit: 10%
  - Hedge ratio: 20%

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 2 Dependencies:**

   - Complete MACD indicator implementation with custom parameters
   - Ensure market data retrieval for 1-minute timeframes works properly
   - Adapt position sizing for micro-positions ($1.00 max)

2. **Phase 3 Integration:**

   - Configure strategy parameters in production-ready code
   - Implement de-minimus testing with $1.00 positions on production Hyperliquid exchange
   - Verify strategy execution and trade lifecycle management
   - Use 1-minute timeframes for accelerated feedback cycles

3. **Phase 4 Monitoring:**

   - Create dedicated MACD strategy dashboard with 1-minute resolution
   - Implement strategy-specific metrics and alerts
   - Ensure real-time monitoring of indicator values and trading signals
   - Prepare Google Cloud Platform monitoring setup

4. **Phase 5 Deployment:**
   - Deploy to Google Cloud Platform for persistent operation
   - Implement cloud-based monitoring and alerting
   - Ensure secure credential management in cloud environment

### Validation Criteria:\*\*

- Successfully identify and act on MACD crossovers in 1-minute timeframes
- Execute trades with proper position sizing and hedging on production exchange
- Monitor and visualize strategy performance in real-time
- Implement all risk management features (stop-loss, take-profit, etc.)
- Validate persistent operation in cloud environment

This MVP implementation is a critical step in proving the system's functionality. Successful
execution of this strategy with minimal capital ($1.00 positions) on the production Hyperliquid
exchange will validate all core components while minimizing financial risk during the evaluation
phase.

## Critical Path Analysis

1. **Immediate Focus**

   - Complete backtesting framework in Phase 2
   - Implement de-minimus real-money testing with $1.00 positions
   - Start basic monitoring setup during Phase 3
   - Begin GCP deployment preparation

2. **Risk Mitigation**

   - Use 1-minute timeframes for faster validation cycles
   - Test with real funds but minimal position sizes
   - Implement basic monitoring for active observation periods
   - Prepare cloud deployment for persistent operation

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Prioritize Hyperliquid exchange integration for MACD MVP
   - Focus on 1-minute candle support for rapid feedback
   - Allocate resources to GCP deployment preparation
   - Ensure monitoring tools support high-frequency data

This roadmap ensures structured development with clear milestones, allowing for incremental
validation and capital protection during the deployment process, with a focus on real production
testing and cloud deployment for persistent operation.
