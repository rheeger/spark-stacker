## Current Implementation Status

Phase 3 is approximately 80% complete. The system has reached a functional state with core
components successfully integrated, and the basic dry run capability is operational.

The TradingEngine properly coordinates interactions between exchange connectors, indicators, and the
risk management system. The StrategyManager effectively handles multiple trading strategies, though
currently only one strategy (RSI-based) is fully implemented.

The WebhookServer successfully receives external signals (e.g., from TradingView), validates them,
and forwards them to the trading engine. The system has been containerized with Docker, simplifying
deployment and ensuring consistent operation across environments.

Testing coverage is good for individual components but lacking in end-to-end system testing and
performance assessment. The dry run mode works well on the Hyperliquid testnet, but needs more
thorough validation and stress testing.

## Testing Status

Unit testing coverage is strong for core components, with comprehensive tests for connectors,
indicators, and the risk management system. Integration testing has made good progress with the
implementation of signal flow tests, but needs expansion to cover the full trading lifecycle and
external interactions.

The RSI strategy simulation test provides a good foundation for strategy validation, but additional
strategy simulations are needed. Performance testing is entirely missing and should be prioritized
to ensure the system can handle production loads.

The primary gaps in this phase are:

1. Completing end-to-end system testing with multiple exchanges and strategies
2. Thorough performance testing under various load conditions
3. Extended dry run validation with comparison to expected outcomes

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Complete backtesting framework integration (CRITICAL PATH)

   - Integrate with historical data sources
   - Implement performance comparison
   - Add strategy validation

2. Finish dry run testing

   - Complete Synthetix testnet integration
   - Implement full trading cycle validation
   - Add extended duration testing

3. Implement performance testing

   - Add latency measurement
   - Implement load testing
   - Create resource utilization assessment

4. Expand integration testing

   - Implement end-to-end system tests
   - Create webhook-to-execution tests
   - Add multi-strategy interaction tests

5. Begin parallel work on monitoring (Phase 4)
   - Set up basic metrics collection
   - Implement essential dashboards
   - Create core control interface
