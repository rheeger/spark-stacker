## Current Implementation Status

Phase 3 is approximately 80% complete. The system has reached a functional state with core
components successfully integrated, and the basic testnet capability is being replaced with a more
practical de-minimus real trading approach.

The TradingEngine properly coordinates interactions between exchange connectors, indicators, and the
risk management system. The StrategyManager effectively handles multiple trading strategies, though
currently only one strategy (RSI-based) is fully implemented.

The WebhookServer successfully receives external signals (e.g., from TradingView), validates them,
and forwards them to the trading engine. The system has been containerized with Docker, simplifying
deployment and ensuring consistent operation across environments.

Testing coverage is good for individual components but lacking in end-to-end system testing and
performance assessment. The dry run approach is being shifted from testnet to small real trades with
minimal capital on production exchanges, starting with Hyperliquid, to ensure consistent and
reliable testing results.
