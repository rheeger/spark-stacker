# Phase 3.5.1: Enhanced Indicator Performance Reporting

## Overview

This phase focuses on building comprehensive HTML-based performance reports for our trading
indicators. Based on our existing test infrastructure, we'll develop standardized reporting
templates that enable quick assessment of indicator predictability and performance over time. The
goal is to create intuitive reports that highlight the most reliable trading signals for
high-leverage trading strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Existing indicator test harness (already implemented)
- Backtesting engine capabilities (already implemented)
- Basic results storage in JSON/Markdown (already implemented)
- Functional exchange connectors (Hyperliquid, etc.)
