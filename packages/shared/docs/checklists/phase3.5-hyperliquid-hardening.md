Total estimated time: 7 weeks

## Pre-Production Validation

Before proceeding to another production test:

1. Run full integration test suite against testnet
2. Perform limited dry-run tests with minimal position sizes
3. Conduct thorough code review of connector implementation
4. Verify all logging systems are functional
5. Perform manual test trades and verify results match expectations

## Implementation Summary

The following key improvements have been made to the Hyperliquid connector:

1. **MetadataWrapper Added**

   - Created a wrapper around the Hyperliquid SDK to handle different API response formats
   - Added automatic format conversion for `meta()` API responses with and without the 'universe'
     key
   - Improved handling of list vs. dictionary response formats

2. **Orderbook Parsing Enhancements**

   - Added support for nested orderbook formats with 'levels' key
   - Implemented support for both array-style `[price, size]` and object-style
     `{"px": price, "sz": size}` formats
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all orderbook data structures

3. **Position Data Handling**

   - Fixed parsing of nested position structures with `type: oneWay` format
   - Added support for complex leverage objects with `{type: "cross", value: 20}` format
   - Improved handling of position indices and position name resolution

4. **Historical Data Improvements**

   - Implemented caching system to reduce API calls
   - Added support for multiple candle data formats
   - Added better timestamp handling and sorting

5. **Error Handling and Resilience**

   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Implemented specific exception types for different failure modes
   - Added graceful handling of connection issues and timeouts

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Created comprehensive test suite for all API endpoints
   - Added proper async/await handling in tests
   - Implemented realistic mock responses based on production data

All tests now pass successfully with the various response formats returned by the Hyperliquid API.
