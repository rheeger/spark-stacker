# 4/16 Production Test Findings

## Executive Summary

Following the 4/13 production test, additional testing on 4/16/2025 revealed that critical issues persist in the Hyperliquid API integration. Despite implementing fixes based on previous findings, the system continues to encounter significant errors that prevent proper trade execution, position monitoring, and historical data retrieval. These issues resulted in a $15 financial loss due to improper order execution and position management.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Historical Data Retrieval Failures

**Issue:** System consistently fails to fetch historical candle data needed for indicator calculations.

**Evidence:**
- Repeated errors: "Received 422 error from Hyperliquid API: Failed to deserialize the JSON body into the target type"
- At 1744778074001, system attempts to fetch historical data but receives 422 error
- MACD calculations failing due to insufficient data: "Not enough valid data points for MACD calculation. Need at least 26, got 1"

**Root Cause:** API request format for historical data is likely incorrect or the system is unable to parse the response format.

### 2. Symbol Translation Issues

**Issue:** System is using "ETH-USD" format but the API expects "ETH".

**Evidence:**
- Multiple instances of "Invalid coin index ETH (universe size: 191)"
- Position retrieval failures due to invalid coin index
- At 1744778074001, user state shows position in "ETH" but system can't find it using "ETH-USD"

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent symbol naming convention between system and API, without proper translation.

### 3. Position Monitoring Failures

**Issue:** System cannot detect or monitor existing positions.

**Evidence:**
- User state shows position: "{'coin': 'ETH', 'szi': '1.2', 'leverage': {'type': 'cross', 'value': 20}..."
- Yet system reports: "Retrieved 0 positions from Hyperliquid"
- Position monitoring thread fails to detect the 1.2 ETH position shown in user state

**Root Cause:** Position data parsing logic is not handling the nested format returned by the API.

### 4. Connection Stability Issues

**Issue:** Websocket connection to Hyperliquid API is unstable.

**Evidence:**
- At 1744778074001, "Connection error while getting user state: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))"
- "Connection to remote host was lost. - goodbye"
- Multiple reconnection attempts visible in the logs

**Root Cause:** Poor connection handling, inadequate retry logic, or API rate limiting.

### 5. Orderbook Parsing Problems

**Issue:** System cannot parse the orderbook structure returned by the API.

**Evidence:**
- Failed with: "Invalid orderbook format: {'coin': 'ETH', 'time': 1744775393531, 'levels': [[{'px': '1591.7', 'sz': '21.5242', 'n': 2}, ...], [...]]}"
- System expecting different format, resulting in "Empty price levels for ETH-USD"

**Root Cause:** Parser doesn't handle the nested 'levels' format with 'px'/'sz' keys in the orderbook response.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Historical Data API Format Issue

The API returns a 422 error when attempting to fetch historical candles:

```
Received 422 error from Hyperliquid API: Failed to deserialize the JSON body into the target type
```

This suggests the request format is incorrect. The API likely expects a different payload structure or parameter format than what our system is sending.

### Position Data Parsing Problem

The API returns position data in a nested format:

```json
'assetPositions': [{'type': 'oneWay', 'position': {'coin': 'ETH', 'szi': '1.2', 'leverage': {'type': 'cross', 'value': 20}, ...}}]
```

Our system fails to properly extract this data, resulting in "Invalid coin index" errors and "Retrieved 0 positions" despite having an open position.

### Symbol Format Inconsistency

Two parallel logs show different behavior:
- In the 363184cc log, the system initially connects successfully and retrieves some data
- In the b8b8a699 log, similar API calls consistently fail

The different formats are evident:
- Internal system: "ETH-USD"
- API response: "ETH"

### Order Processing Disconnect

In the first log (363184cc):
1. System places a BUY order for 7.20 ETH but only 1.2 is filled
2. Hedge order (SELL 1.44 ETH) is rejected with "Order could not immediately match against any resting orders"

Despite partial success with the main order, the system never updates its understanding of its position, showing the core issues with position tracking.

## Impact on Trading

1. **Failed Strategy Execution**: Without historical data, MACD indicators cannot generate proper signals
2. **Unmonitored Positions**: The system cannot detect its own open positions, creating risk of duplicate positions or improper position sizing
3. **Partial Order Fills**: Orders are partially filled but not properly tracked
4. **Financial Loss**: Approximately $15 was lost due to these issues and improper position management

## Comparison to Previous Test (4/13)

While some issues are similar to the 4/13 test, new problems have been identified:

1. **Historical Data Retrieval** - New specific error (422) identified
2. **Symbol Translation** - More clearly identified as a key issue affecting multiple functions
3. **Connection Stability** - More pronounced connection drops occurring regularly
4. **Position Format Handling** - Clear evidence that the nested 'oneWay' structure isn't being parsed

## Required Improvements

The phase3.5-hyperliquid-hardening.md checklist should be updated with the following additional items:

1. **Symbol Translation Layer**:
   - Create bidirectional symbol translation between internal format (ETH-USD) and API format (ETH)
   - Add validation to ensure all operations use correct symbol format for the context

2. **Historical Data Request/Response Handling**:
   - Capture exact request format for historical candles that works with the API
   - Document payload structure and error conditions
   - Add fallback mechanisms for temporary historical data failures

3. **Position Data Parsing Enhancements**:
   - Update position parser to correctly handle the nested 'oneWay' format
   - Add validation for extracted position data
   - Implement position reconciliation mechanisms

4. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement more robust websocket connection handling
   - Add connection health monitoring
   - Enhanced reconnection logic with proper backoff

5. **Trade Execution Verification**:
   - Add post-trade verification steps
   - Implement verification of executed orders
   - Create alerts for partially filled or rejected orders

All these improvements must be properly tested with actual API response formats before any further production testing.
