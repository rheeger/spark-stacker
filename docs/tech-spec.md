# Technical Specification: On-Chain Perpetual Trading System

## System Overview

The **On-Chain Perpetual Trading System** is a Python-based trading application designed to execute high-leverage positions on decentralized perpetual futures exchanges while implementing sophisticated hedging strategies to protect principal. The system receives signals from technical indicators, executes primary and hedge trades, and actively manages risk throughout the trade lifecycle.

### Hedging Implementation

The core hedging strategy will be implemented as follows:

```python
# Pseudocode for hedge execution
def execute_hedged_trade(signal, asset, confidence):
    # Calculate position sizes
    available_margin = get_available_margin()
    main_position_margin = available_margin * MAIN_POSITION_RATIO  # e.g. 0.8
    hedge_position_margin = available_margin * HEDGE_POSITION_RATIO  # e.g. 0.2
    
    # Calculate leverage based on confidence and risk settings
    main_leverage = calculate_dynamic_leverage(confidence, MAX_LEVERAGE)
    hedge_leverage = HEDGE_LEVERAGE_RATIO * main_leverage  # e.g. 0.5 * main_leverage
    
    # Execute main position in signal direction
    main_order = {
        "asset": asset,
        "side": signal.direction,  # LONG or SHORT
        "margin": main_position_margin,
        "leverage": main_leverage,
        "order_type": "MARKET"
    }
    main_order_id = exchange.place_order(main_order)
    
    # Confirm main order execution
    main_position = wait_for_order_execution(main_order_id)
    if not main_position:
        log.error("Main position failed to execute")
        return None
    
    # Execute hedge in opposite direction
    hedge_order = {
        "asset": asset,
        "side": "SHORT" if signal.direction == "LONG" else "LONG",
        "margin": hedge_position_margin,
        "leverage": hedge_leverage,
        "order_type": "MARKET"
    }
    hedge_order_id = hedge_exchange.place_order(hedge_order)
    
    # Confirm hedge execution
    hedge_position = wait_for_order_execution(hedge_order_id)
    
    # Return combined position for monitoring
    return {
        "main_position": main_position,
        "hedge_position": hedge_position,
        "net_exposure": calculate_net_exposure(main_position, hedge_position),
        "timestamp": current_time()
    }
```

### Risk Management Implementation

```python
# Pseudocode for risk monitoring
def monitor_position_health(combined_position):
    # Track margin ratios for both positions
    main_margin_ratio = get_margin_ratio(combined_position["main_position"])
    hedge_margin_ratio = get_margin_ratio(combined_position["hedge_position"])
    
    # Check for liquidation risk on main position
    if main_margin_ratio < LIQUIDATION_WARNING_THRESHOLD:
        if hedge_margin_ratio > HEDGE_PROFIT_THRESHOLD:
            # Close profitable hedge to free up margin
            close_position(combined_position["hedge_position"])
            log.info("Closed hedge position to protect main position")
            return True
        else:
            # Close both positions if both are at risk
            close_position(combined_position["main_position"])
            close_position(combined_position["hedge_position"])
            log.warning("Closed both positions due to liquidation risk")
            return False
    
    # Check for stop-loss conditions
    net_pnl_percent = calculate_net_pnl_percent(combined_position)
    if net_pnl_percent < STOP_LOSS_THRESHOLD:
        # Close both positions
        close_position(combined_position["main_position"])
        close_position(combined_position["hedge_position"])
        log.info(f"Stop-loss triggered at {net_pnl_percent}%")
        return False
    
    return True  # Position is healthy
```

## Performance & Latency Considerations

- **Execution Speed Optimization:**
  - Websocket connections for real-time data to minimize latency
  - Asynchronous request handling where appropriate
  - Prioritization of critical transactions (e.g., stop-loss execution)

- **Network Reliability:**
  - Connection retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Redundant endpoints for critical exchanges
  - Transaction status verification

- **Transaction Timing:**
  - Account for Synthetix oracle delay (~8 seconds between updates)
  - Optimize order placement timing to account for network conditions
  - Monitor execution slippage compared to expected price
