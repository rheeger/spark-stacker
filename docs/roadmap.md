## Phase 6: Continuous Improvement & Expansion

**Status: PLANNED** **Dependencies: None (Can Start During Phase 5)** **Parallel Work: Independent
Features**

Core activities:

- Add advanced order types (trailing stops, OCO orders)
- Implement additional exchange connectors
- Create advanced risk management features
- Integrate machine learning capabilities
- Develop extended analytics and reporting
- Implement comprehensive testing improvement plan to reach 85%+ code coverage

## Critical Path Analysis

1. **Immediate Focus**

   - Complete backtesting framework in Phase 2
   - Start basic monitoring setup during Phase 3
   - Begin essential control interface development

2. **Risk Mitigation**

   - Implement basic monitoring earlier in the process
   - Start with minimal viable control interface
   - Focus on core functionality before advanced features

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Prioritize backtesting framework completion
   - Allocate resources to parallel development where possible
   - Focus on critical path items before nice-to-have features

This roadmap ensures structured development with clear milestones, allowing for incremental
validation and capital protection during the deployment process.
