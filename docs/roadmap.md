# Development Roadmap & Progress Tracking

## **Phase 1: System Design & Planning**

### Tasks:

âœ… Define system architecture and components.
âœ… Research and document API specifications for exchanges (Synthetix, Hyperliquid).
âœ… Outline indicator framework and Pine Script integration.
âœ… Design risk management module structure.
âœ… Finalize core product requirements and user workflows.

### Implementation Details:
- Requirement Specification for supported indicators and exchanges
- Environment Setup (Python repositories with necessary libraries)
- Prototype Core Logic with basic data fetching and decision logic
- Basic Order Execution Testing on testnets
- Hedge Execution Testing with opposite orders in sequence

- [Hyperliquid API Docs](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/)

## **Phase 2: Core Development & Backtesting**

### Tasks:

âœ… Implement exchange connectors (Hyperliquid, Synthetix pending).
âœ… Develop order execution logic (market/limit orders, leverage handling).
âœ… Implement technical indicators (RSI implemented, more pending).
âœ… Integrate Pine Script support for user-defined strategies.
âœ… Build hedging mechanism to protect principal.
âœ… Develop risk management logic (max leverage, stop-loss, drawdown control).
ðŸ”² Implement backtesting framework for strategy validation.

### Implementation Details:
- âœ… Indicator Module Development with Pandas (RSI implemented)
- âœ… Hedging Logic implementation with parameterized hedge ratios
- ðŸ”² Backtesting Framework development for historical validation
- ðŸ”² Historical Data Collection for accurate backtests
- ðŸ”² Parameter Optimization based on backtesting results
- ðŸ”² Risk Scenario Simulation for extreme market conditions

## **Phase 3: Integration & Dry Run**

### Tasks:

âœ… Unit testing of API connections and order execution.
âœ… Full integration of all components into a cohesive system.
ðŸ”² Paper trading on testnets for strategy validation.
ðŸŸ¡ End-to-end dry runs with continuous monitoring.
ðŸ”² Performance and latency evaluation.
âœ… Implement error handling and fail-safe mechanisms.
âœ… Security checks for API keys and sensitive information.

### Implementation Details:
- âœ… Combined data ingestion, indicator evaluation, trade execution, and risk management
- âœ… Unit test framework with fixtures and robust test coverage
- âœ… Continuous test automation with file watching
- ðŸŸ¡ Run on testnets or paper trading mode without real capital
- ðŸ”² Verify signal pickup, order placement, and stop management
- ðŸ”² Test reliability with network disconnection scenarios
- ðŸ”² Measure response time from signal to order execution
- âœ… Secure sensitive information (API keys, private keys)

## **Phase 4: Deployment & Live Trading**

### Tasks:

ðŸ”² Deploy system in controlled live environment with minimal capital.
ðŸ”² Setup monitoring tools and alerts for critical events.
ðŸ”² Monitor real-time performance and compare with backtests.
ðŸ”² Performance assessment and strategy adjustments.
ðŸ”² Scale system for increased capital deployment.

### Implementation Details:
- ðŸ”² Initial deployment with small capital amounts
- âœ… Implement logging for every action (signals, orders, balance changes)
- ðŸ”² Set up alerts for critical events via messaging or email
- ðŸ”² Compare live trading results with backtest expectations
- ðŸ”² Gradually increase capital allocation after validation

## **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement & Expansion**

### Tasks:

ðŸ”² Introduce additional order types (trailing stops, OCO orders).
ðŸ”² Expand trade monitoring and analytics features.
ðŸ”² Automate updates for new exchange API changes.
ðŸ”² Add support for additional exchanges.
ðŸ”² Implement ML-based trade optimization (future roadmap).

### Implementation Details:
- ðŸ”² Periodic reviews of performance and integration of new indicators
- ðŸ”² Updates for any API changes on Synthetix or Hyperliquid
- ðŸ”² A/B testing of new strategies or parameters
- ðŸ”² Shadow backtests for continuous validation
