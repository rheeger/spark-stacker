## Current Implementation Status

Phase 5 is in planning stage. No implementation work has started on this phase, as it depends on the
successful completion of Phases 3 and 4.

The system has a functioning dry run mode which provides a foundation for the eventual live
deployment, but more testing and validation are needed before real capital is deployed.

A basic Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration have been created for containerization, which
will facilitate the production deployment process. Security considerations have been addressed in
the current implementation, particularly around credential management and API authentication.

This phase represents the culmination of the development effort, transitioning from a testing and
development environment to a production trading system managing real capital. Careful planning and
validation will be critical for a successful deployment.
