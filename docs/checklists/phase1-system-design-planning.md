# Phase 1: System Design & Planning (COMPLETED)

## Architecture Design
- ✅ Defined modular system architecture with clear separation of components
- ✅ Established component interfaces and communication patterns
- ✅ Designed data flow through the system (signals → execution → monitoring)
- ✅ Created class diagrams and relationship models
- ✅ Established error handling and fail-safe mechanisms

## Exchange Research
- ✅ Documented Hyperliquid API endpoints and authentication methods
  - ✅ Order placement and management endpoints mapped
  - ✅ Market data retrieval methods identified
  - ✅ Account and position information endpoints cataloged
  - ✅ Rate limits and restrictions documented
- ✅ Investigated Synthetix Perps contracts and interfaces
  - ✅ Contract ABIs documented
  - ✅ Function signatures for order execution identified
  - ✅ Oracle price update mechanics analyzed
- ✅ Explored Coinbase Advanced Trade API
  - ✅ Endpoint structure and parameters documented
  - ✅ Authentication flow mapped out
  - ✅ Real-time data streaming options evaluated

## Indicator Framework
- ✅ Designed BaseIndicator abstract class with required interface methods
- ✅ Created signal format specification for cross-indicator compatibility
- ✅ Developed indicator registration and factory pattern for dynamic loading
- ✅ Defined configuration schema for indicator parameters
- ✅ Structured Pine Script alert format for webhook integration

## Risk Management
- ✅ Defined risk parameters (leverage limits, position sizing, hedge ratios)
- ✅ Designed position monitoring and liquidation prevention mechanisms
- ✅ Created formulas for margin requirements and liquidation thresholds
- ✅ Specified hedge position sizing and correlation calculations
- ✅ Established account-wide risk controls (max drawdown, capital allocation)

## Requirements Documentation
- ✅ Created technical specification document (docs/tech-spec.md)
- ✅ Developed product requirements document (docs/prd.md)
- ✅ Established user workflow documentation (docs/userguide.md)
- ✅ Drafted initial roadmap with milestones (docs/roadmap.md)
- ✅ Created testing plan (docs/testing-improvement-plan.md)

## Current Implementation Status
Phase 1 is fully completed, with all design and planning documents created and refined. The architecture design establishes clear boundaries between system components and defines clean interfaces for future extensibility.

The design accommodates multiple exchanges (currently Hyperliquid and Coinbase, with Synthetix planned) and establishes a flexible indicator framework that allows for easy addition of new technical indicators beyond the current RSI implementation.

The risk management design balances maximizing returns through leverage while implementing sophisticated hedging strategies to protect principal during adverse market movements.

All implementation code follows the architecture and interfaces defined in this phase.
