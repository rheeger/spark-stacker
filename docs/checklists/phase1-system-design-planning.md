# Phase 1: System Design & Planning (COMPLETED)

## Architecture Design

- ✅ Defined modular system architecture with clear separation of components
- ✅ Established component interfaces and communication patterns
- ✅ Designed data flow through the system (signals → execution → monitoring)
- ✅ Created class diagrams and relationship models
- ✅ Established error handling and fail-safe mechanisms

## Exchange Research

- ✅ Documented Hyperliquid API endpoints and authentication methods
  - ✅ Order placement and management endpoints mapped
  - ✅ Market data retrieval methods identified
  - ✅ Account and position information endpoints cataloged
  - ✅ Rate limits and restrictions documented
- ✅ Investigated Synthetix Perps contracts and interfaces
  - ✅ Contract ABIs documented
  - ✅ Function signatures for order execution identified
  - ✅ Oracle price update mechanics analyzed
- ✅ Explored Coinbase Advanced Trade API
  - ✅ Endpoint structure and parameters documented
  - ✅ Authentication flow mapped out
  - ✅ Real-time data streaming options evaluated

## Indicator Framework

- ✅ Designed BaseIndicator abstract class with required interface methods
- ✅ Created signal format specification for cross-indicator compatibility
- ✅ Developed indicator registration and factory pattern for dynamic loading
- ✅ Defined configuration schema for indicator parameters
- ✅ Structured Pine Script alert format for webhook integration

## Risk Management

- ✅ Defined risk parameters (leverage limits, position sizing, hedge ratios)
- ✅ Designed position monitoring and liquidation prevention mechanisms
- ✅ Created formulas for margin requirements and liquidation thresholds
- ✅ Specified hedge position sizing and correlation calculations
- ✅ Established account-wide risk controls (max drawdown, capital allocation)

## Requirements Documentation

- ✅ Created technical specification document (docs/tech-spec.md)
- ✅ Developed product requirements document (docs/prd.md)
- ✅ Established user workflow documentation (docs/userguide.md)
- ✅ Drafted initial roadmap with milestones (docs/roadmap.md)
- ✅ Created testing plan (docs/testing-improvement-plan.md)

## Testing Strategy

- ✅ Designed test directory structure and organization
  - ✅ Established unit test directory for component-level testing
  - ✅ Created integration test structure for cross-component testing
  - ✅ Set up simulation test structure for end-to-end strategy testing
- ✅ Defined test fixture approach in conftest.py
  - ✅ Created sample price data generator for consistent indicator testing
  - ✅ Implemented mock exchange connector for isolated component testing
  - ✅ Added sample configuration fixtures for testing configuration-dependent components
- ✅ Established expected test types for each component:
  - ✅ Indicator tests should verify calculation accuracy and signal generation logic
  - ✅ Connector tests should validate API interaction and error handling
  - ✅ Risk management tests should confirm position sizing and limit enforcement
  - ✅ Trading engine tests should verify signal processing and order execution
- ✅ Created test fixtures and utilities to facilitate testing across all phases

## Current Implementation Status

Phase 1 is fully completed, with all design and planning documents created and refined. The
architecture design establishes clear boundaries between system components and defines clean
interfaces for future extensibility.

The design accommodates multiple exchanges (currently Hyperliquid and Coinbase, with Synthetix
planned) and establishes a flexible indicator framework that allows for easy addition of new
technical indicators beyond the current RSI implementation.

The risk management design balances maximizing returns through leverage while implementing
sophisticated hedging strategies to protect principal during adverse market movements.

All implementation code follows the architecture and interfaces defined in this phase.
