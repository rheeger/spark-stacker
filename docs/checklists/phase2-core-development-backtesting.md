## Current Implementation Status

Phase 2 is approximately 80% complete. The core components for live trading functionality are
operational, with robust exchange connectivity (particularly for Hyperliquid), comprehensive
technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages), and comprehensive risk
management.

The Coinbase connector is partially implemented, focusing on data retrieval capabilities, but lacks
full trading functionality. Multiple technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving
Averages) are fully implemented with a well-designed framework that makes adding additional
indicators straightforward.

The risk management system is fully operational, with thorough implementations of position sizing,
leverage control, and hedging mechanics. The hedging functionality is a key differentiator, allowing
for sophisticated capital protection while maintaining significant upside exposure.

The main gap is the backtesting framework, which is entirely unimplemented. This prevents proper
historical validation of trading strategies and parameter optimization before live deployment.

## Unit Testing Status

Unit testing for core components is largely complete and thorough, with good coverage of:

- Exchange connectors and factory
- Indicators and indicator factory
- Risk manager
- Trading engine

All implemented indicators have comprehensive tests validating their calculations and signal
generation logic. The trading engine and risk manager tests verify their core functionality.
However, some aspects of the webhook server need more thorough testing coverage.

Additionally, no tests have been implemented for the backtesting framework as it hasn't been
developed yet.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Complete backtesting framework (CRITICAL PATH)
   - Start with historical data retrieval
   - Implement basic performance metrics
   - Add trade simulation
2. Finish Coinbase connector implementation
   - Complete trading functionality
   - Implement hedging capabilities
3. Add comprehensive tests for backtesting components as they are developed
   - Create tests for historical data processing
   - Implement validation tests for performance metrics
   - Add tests for simulation accuracy
