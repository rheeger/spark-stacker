## Backtesting Framework (CRITICAL PATH)
- ðŸ”² Historical data retrieval and storage not implemented
  - ðŸ”² Data source integration (CSV, API, database)
  - ðŸ”² Data cleaning and normalization
  - ðŸ”² Storage optimization for large datasets
- ðŸ”² Indicator performance on historical data not implemented
  - ðŸ”² Historical signal generation
  - ðŸ”² Performance metrics calculation
  - ðŸ”² Strategy parameter optimization
- ðŸ”² Trade simulation with realistic fees/slippage not implemented
  - ðŸ”² Fee structure modeling
  - ðŸ”² Slippage simulation
  - ðŸ”² Order book depth simulation
- ðŸ”² Performance metric calculation not implemented
  - ðŸ”² Returns calculation
  - ðŸ”² Risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown)
  - ðŸ”² Position sizing optimization
- ðŸ”² Strategy parameter optimization not implemented
  - ðŸ”² Grid search implementation
  - ðŸ”² Genetic algorithm optimization
  - ðŸ”² Walk-forward analysis

## Current Implementation Status
Phase 2 is approximately 75% complete. The core components for live trading functionality are operational, with robust exchange connectivity (particularly for Hyperliquid), basic indicator functionality (RSI), and comprehensive risk management.

The Coinbase connector is partially implemented, focusing on data retrieval capabilities, but lacks full trading functionality. One technical indicator (RSI) is fully implemented with a well-designed framework that makes adding additional indicators straightforward.

The risk management system is fully operational, with thorough implementations of position sizing, leverage control, and hedging mechanics. The hedging functionality is a key differentiator, allowing for sophisticated capital protection while maintaining significant upside exposure.

The main gap is the backtesting framework, which is entirely unimplemented. This prevents proper historical validation of trading strategies and parameter optimization before live deployment.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Complete backtesting framework (CRITICAL PATH)
   - Start with historical data retrieval
   - Implement basic performance metrics
   - Add trade simulation
2. Finish Coinbase connector implementation
   - Complete trading functionality
   - Implement hedging capabilities
3. Add additional technical indicators
   - MACD
   - Bollinger Bands
   - Moving Averages
