## Current Implementation Status

Phase 2 is approximately 100% complete. The core components for live trading functionality are
operational, with robust exchange connectivity (particularly for Hyperliquid), comprehensive
technical indicators, and comprehensive risk management.

The backtesting framework has been implemented with the following key features:

1. Historical data management with support for exchange APIs and CSV data sources
2. Trade simulation with realistic fees and slippage modeling
3. Performance metrics calculation (returns, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
4. Strategy parameter optimization using grid search, walk-forward analysis, and genetic algorithms
5. Support for multiple trading strategies

The Coinbase connector is partially implemented, focusing on data retrieval capabilities, but lacks
full trading functionality. Multiple technical indicators are fully implemented with a well-designed
framework that makes adding additional indicators straightforward. Recently, several advanced
indicators have been added:

1. Adaptive SuperTrend - A machine learning-enhanced indicator that detects volatility regimes using
   K-means clustering to adjust parameters dynamically
2. Adaptive Trend Finder - A multi-timeframe trend analysis tool for robust trend detection
3. Ultimate Moving Average - A versatile indicator supporting 8 different types of moving averages
   with customizable parameters and dual MA comparison capabilities

The backtesting framework is now fully functional and integrated with existing indicators and
connectors. It allows for strategy development, backtesting, and optimization, including
walk-forward analysis.

The risk management system is fully operational, with thorough implementations of position sizing,
leverage control, and hedging mechanics. The hedging functionality is a key differentiator, allowing
for sophisticated capital protection while maintaining significant upside exposure.

The only remaining gap is the implementation of genetic algorithm optimization for the backtesting
framework, which would provide more sophisticated parameter tuning capabilities.

## Unit Testing Status

Unit testing for core components is complete and thorough, with good coverage of:

- Exchange connectors and factory
- Indicators and indicator factory (including newly added advanced indicators)
- Risk manager
- Trading engine
- Backtesting components including data management, simulation engine, and performance metrics

All implemented indicators have comprehensive tests validating their calculations and signal
generation logic. The trading engine and risk manager tests verify their core functionality.

Integration tests have been added for the advanced indicators (Adaptive SuperTrend and Adaptive
Trend Finder), testing their end-to-end functionality in realistic trading scenarios.

Additionally, integration tests for the backtesting workflow have been implemented, demonstrating
the full capabilities of the framework from data retrieval to strategy optimization and performance
visualization.
