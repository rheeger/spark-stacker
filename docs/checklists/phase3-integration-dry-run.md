  - âœ… Volume mapping for logs and configuration
  - âœ… Health check implementation
- âœ… Added bootstrap script for initialization
  - âœ… Environment variable processing
  - âœ… Configuration file generation
  - âœ… Credential validation

## Current Implementation Status
Phase 3 is approximately 80% complete. The system has reached a functional state with core components successfully integrated, and the basic dry run capability is operational.

The TradingEngine properly coordinates interactions between exchange connectors, indicators, and the risk management system. The StrategyManager effectively handles multiple trading strategies, though currently only one strategy (RSI-based) is fully implemented.

The WebhookServer successfully receives external signals (e.g., from TradingView), validates them, and forwards them to the trading engine. The system has been containerized with Docker, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistent operation across environments.

Testing coverage is good for individual components but lacking in end-to-end system testing and performance assessment. The dry run mode works well on the Hyperliquid testnet, but needs more thorough validation and stress testing.

The primary gaps in this phase are:
1. Completing end-to-end system testing with multiple exchanges and strategies
2. Thorough performance testing under various load conditions
3. Extended dry run validation with comparison to expected outcomes

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Complete backtesting framework integration (CRITICAL PATH)
   - Integrate with historical data sources
   - Implement performance comparison
   - Add strategy validation

2. Finish dry run testing
   - Complete Synthetix testnet integration
   - Implement full trading cycle validation
   - Add extended duration testing

3. Implement performance testing
   - Add latency measurement
   - Implement load testing
   - Create resource utilization assessment

4. Begin parallel work on monitoring (Phase 4)
   - Set up basic metrics collection
   - Implement essential dashboards
   - Create core control interface
